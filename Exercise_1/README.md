# Research Algorithms - Exercise 1

This folder contains the implementation for Exercise 1 of the Research Algorithms course.

## Contents

- `Ex1.py`: Main implementation file for the exercise questions
- `Ex1-Tests.py`: Unit tests for the implementations
- `Question 4 solution.jpeg`: Solution image for Question 4

## Topics Covered

### Question 1: Safe Call

Implementation of a `safe_call` function that validates function argument types based on type annotations before calling the function.

### Question 2: Breadth-First Search

Implementation of a breadth-first search algorithm to find paths between nodes in a graph.

### Question 3: Deep Sorted

Implementation of a recursive sorting function that can handle nested data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets).

### Question 4: Coding Game Challenge

Solution to the "The Descent" challenge on CodinGame.

## Running the Code

```bash
# To run the tests
python Ex1-Tests.py
```

## Dependencies

- networkx: For graph operations in tests
- unittest: For test framework
